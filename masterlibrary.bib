abstract = {The remarkable development in photovoltaic (PV) technologies over the past 5 years calls for a renewed assessment of their performance and potential for future progress. Here, we analyse the progress in cells and modules based on single-crystalline GaAs, Si, GaInP and InP, multicrystalline Si as well as thin films of polycrystalline CdTe and CuIn x Ga 1−x Se 2 . In addition, we analyse the PV developments of the more recently emerged lead halide perovskites together with notable improvements in sustainable chalcogenides, organic PVs and quantum dots technologies. In addition to power conversion efficiencies, we consider many of the factors that affect power output for each cell type and note improvements in control over the optoelectronic quality of PV-relevant materials and interfaces and the discovery of new material properties. By comparing PV cell parameters across technologies, we appraise how far each technology may progress in the near future. Although accurate or revolutionary developments cannot be predicted, cross-fertilization between technologies often occurs, making achievements in one cell type an indicator of evolutionary developments in others. This knowledge transfer is timely, as the development of metal halide perovskites is helping to unite previously disparate, technology-focused strands of PV research.},

@article{Shockley1961,
abstract = {In order to find an upper theoretical limit for the efficiency of p-n junction solar energy converters, a limiting efficiency, called the detailed balance limit of efficiency, has been calculated for an ideal case in which the only recombination mechanism of hole-electron pairs is radiative as required by the principle of detailed balance. The efficiency is also calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed fraction fc of the total recombination, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30{\%} for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1. Actual junctions do not obey the predicted current-voltage relationship, and reasons for the difference and its relevance to efficiency are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1961 The American Institute of Physics.},

@misc{Ram2018,
abstract = {In recent years, continuous depletion of conventional energy resources and the fluctuating fuel cost have motivated research on alternative source for power generation. To effectively harvest power from the green energy resources, extensive research have been carried out in literature. Solar energy being the foremost among all other renewable energy resources has evolved as a reliable substitute for the conventional power generation. Unlike other sources, real time research on Photovoltaic (PV) Systems is a difficult assignment as it necessitates an accurate PV emulator that can precisely replicate the nonlinear characteristics of a PV cell. PV Researchers have developed emulators of different type utilizing various configurations. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive review on different PV emulator topologies so as to gather all the research activities that are scattered in this arena under a common umbrella. Further this paper provides a detailed analysis of each technique emphasizing on its (i) Realization cost (ii) Accuracy (iii) Level of complexity (iv) Sensitiveness to varying environmental conditions (v) Hardware implementation and (vi) Efficiency.},

abstract = {A major update of solar cell technology and the solar marketplace. Since the first publication of this important volume over a decade ago, dramatic changes have taken place with the solar market growing almost 100-fold and the U.S. moving from first to fourth place in the world market as analyzed in this Second Edition. Three bold new opportunities are identified for any countries wanting to improve market position. The first is combining pin solar cells with 3X concentration to achieve economic competitiveness near term. The second is charging battery-powered cars with solar cell-generated electricity from arrays in surrounding areas-including the car owners' homes-while simultaneously reducing their home electricity bills by over ninety percent. The third is formation of economic {\textcopyright}unions{\textcopyright} of sufficient combined economic size to be major competitors. In this updated edition, feed-in tariffs are identified as the most effective approach for public policy. Reasons are provided to explain why pin solar cells outperform more traditional pn solar cells. Field test data are reported for nineteen percent pin solar cells and for {\~{}}500X concentrating systems with bare cell efficiencies approaching forty percent. Paths to bare cell efficiencies over fifty percent are described, and key missing program elements are identified. Since government support is needed for new technology prototype integration and qualification testing before manufacturing scale up, the key economic measure is identified in this volume as the electricity cost in cents per kilowatt-hour at the complete installed system level, rather than just the up-front solar cell modules' costs in dollars per watt. This Second Edition will benefit technologists in the fields of solar cells and systems; solar cell researchers; power systems designers; academics studying microelectronics, semiconductors, and solar cells; business students and investors with a technical focus; and government and political officials developing public policy. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

@article{Carrero2007,
abstract = {When a photovoltaic system is to be sized, different PV modules are considered. The optimisation of such systems is always the goal, but the choice of the PV module with best performance should also be considered. Nevertheless, selecting a module from catalogue data has certain inconveniences. First, because those data allow only comparisons with absolute magnitudes, the conclusions about which module is the most appropriate is not easy. Second, data provided in catalogues are not sufficient to know the module behaviour under conditions different from standard. This paper deals with the normalisation of the modules data by considering a base that allows for obtaining a "per unit" representation. For modelling and studying the modules under non-standard conditions it is necessary to know series and shunt resistances, but that is not easy. Then, by simulations, it is possible to show the influence of these resistances in the module behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Villalva2009,
abstract = {This paper proposes a method of modeling and simulation of photovoltaic arrays. The main objective is to find the parameters of the nonlinear I-V equation by adjusting the curve at three points: open circuit, maximum power, and short circuit. Given these three points, which are provided by all commercial array datasheets, the method finds the best I-V equation for the single-diode photovoltaic (PV) model including the effect of the series and parallel resistances, and warranties that the maximum power of the model matches with the maximum power of the real array. With the parameters of the adjusted I-V equation, one can build a PV circuit model with any circuit simulator by using basic math blocks. The modeling method and the proposed circuit model are useful for power electronics designers who need a simple, fast, accurate, and easy-to-use modeling method for using in simulations of PV systems. In the first pages, the reader will find a tutorial on PV devices and will understand the parameters that compose the single-diode PV model. The modeling method is then introduced and presented in details. The model is validated with experimental data of commercial PV arrays. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

It provides the concepts, features, and highlights the advantages and drawbacks of three main PV cell models, namely the single diode RS-, RP- and the two-diode. For the parameter estimation techniques, both the analytical and the soft computing approach are covered. A critical evaluation is carried out to summarize the performance of the models, while at the end, a summary of the future trend and direction of research is given. Since the literature on this subject is very large and dispersed, the availability a single cohesive and comprehensive document on the subject matter is crucial in order to piece the information together and understand the bigger picture. Therefore it is envisaged that this work will be convenient for new entrants as well as experienced researchers and practitioners to update their knowledge in the latest development in the area of PV modelling and simulation.},

@misc{Jamil2017,
abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the renewable energy (RE) technologies that offers a fast option for deployment. It is rated according to its maximum DC power output (Wp) which is obtained under Standard Test Condition. However, this is seldom encountered when under actual operating condition where it is sturdily influenced by surrounding climate; hence, it affects performance of the PV module. Soiling is a factor caused by the accumulation of dust and dirt on the PV surface and limiting the penetration of solar energy; hence, reduces the energy output. This paper discusses in details on the types of soiling and presents some mitigation techniques which have been studied and developed. The advantages and disadvantages on the mitigation techniques were also explained. The comparison of each method were simplified and summarized in details into two tables so that they can be a guide in selecting the most appropriate method for soiling mitigation.},

abstract = {Thin film solar cells (TFSC) are a promising approach for terrestrial and space photovoltaics and offer a wide variety of choices in terms of the device design and fabrication. A variety of substrates (flexible or rigid, metal or insulator) can be used for deposition of different layers (contact, buffer, absorber, reflector, etc.) using different techniques (PVD, CVD, ECD, plasma-based, hybrid, etc.). Such versatility allows tailoring and engineering of the layers in order to improve device performance. For large-area devices required for realistic applications, thin-film device fabrication becomes complex and requires proper control over the entire process sequence. Proper understanding of thin-film deposition processes can help in achieving high-efficiency devices over large areas, as has been demonstrated commercially for different cells. Research and development in new, exotic and simple materials and devices, and innovative, but simple manufacturing processes need to be pursued in a focussed manner. Which cell(s) and which technologies will ultimately succeed commercially continue to be anybody's guess, but it would surely be determined by the simplicity of manufacturability and the cost per reliable watt. Cheap and moderately efficient TFSC are expected to receive a due commercial place under the sun. Copyright 2004 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},
