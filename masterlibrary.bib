abstract = {Thin film solar cells (TFSC) are a promising approach for terrestrial and space photovoltaics and offer a wide variety of choices in terms of the device design and fabrication. A variety of substrates (flexible or rigid, metal or insulator) can be used for deposition of different layers (contact, buffer, absorber, reflector, etc.) using different techniques (PVD, CVD, ECD, plasma-based, hybrid, etc.). Such versatility allows tailoring and engineering of the layers in order to improve device performance. For large-area devices required for realistic applications, thin-film device fabrication becomes complex and requires proper control over the entire process sequence. Proper understanding of thin-film deposition processes can help in achieving high-efficiency devices over large areas, as has been demonstrated commercially for different cells. Research and development in new, exotic and simple materials and devices, and innovative, but simple manufacturing processes need to be pursued in a focussed manner. Which cell(s) and which technologies will ultimately succeed commercially continue to be anybody's guess, but it would surely be determined by the simplicity of manufacturability and the cost per reliable watt. Cheap and moderately efficient TFSC are expected to receive a due commercial place under the sun. Copyright 2004 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Here, we analyse the progress in cells and modules based on single-crystalline GaAs, Si, GaInP and InP, multicrystalline Si as well as thin films of polycrystalline CdTe and CuIn x Ga 1−x Se 2 . In addition, we analyse the PV developments of the more recently emerged lead halide perovskites together with notable improvements in sustainable chalcogenides, organic PVs and quantum dots technologies. In addition to power conversion efficiencies, we consider many of the factors that affect power output for each cell type and note improvements in control over the optoelectronic quality of PV-relevant materials and interfaces and the discovery of new material properties. By comparing PV cell parameters across technologies, we appraise how far each technology may progress in the near future. Although accurate or revolutionary developments cannot be predicted, cross-fertilization between technologies often occurs, making achievements in one cell type an indicator of evolutionary developments in others. This knowledge transfer is timely, as the development of metal halide perovskites is helping to unite previously disparate, technology-focused strands of PV research.},

abstract = {In order to improve the performance of solar energy systems, accurate modeling of current vs. voltage (I-V) characteristics of solar cells has attracted the attention of various researches. The main drawback in accurate modeling is the lack of information about the precise parameter values which indeed characterize the solar cell. Since such parameters cannot be extracted from the datasheet specifications, an optimization technique is necessary to adjust experimental data to the solar cell model. Considering the I-V characteristics of solar cells, the optimization task involves the solution of complex non-linear and multi-modal objective functions. Several optimization approaches have been proposed to identify the parameters of solar cells. However, most of them obtain sub-optimal solutions due to their premature convergence and their difficulty to overcome local minima in multi-modal problems. This paper proposes the use of the ABC (artificial bee colony) algorithm to accurately identify the solar cells' parameters. The ABC algorithm is an evolutionary method inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bees. In comparison with other evolutionary algorithms, ABC exhibits a better search capacity to face multi-modal objective functions. In order to illustrate the proficiency of the proposed approach, it is compared to other well-known optimization methods. Experimental results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method in terms of robustness and accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The two diode model of a solar cell is used as the basis for the extraction problem. The analyses carried out using synthetic current-voltage (I-V) data set showed that the proposed P-DE outperforms other Evolutionary Algorithm methods, namely the simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). P-DE consistently converges to the global optimum values very rapidly. The performances are evaluated using the well known quality test and student T-tests. Furthermore, the P-DE extraction method is practically validated by six solar modules of different types (multi-crystalline, mono-crystalline, and thin-film). The results were found to be in close agreement with the experimental I-V data set, especially at very low irradiance values. The latter can be very useful in predicting the performance of the solar system under partial shading conditions. The main application of the proposed work is the possibility of developing a highly accurate simulator for solar PV system designer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

There are two main problems in this field: having a useful model to characterize the solar cells and the absence of data about photovoltaic cells. This situation even affects the performance of the photovoltaic modules (panels). The characteristics of the current vs. voltage are used to describe the behavior of solar cells. Considering such values, the design problem involves the solution of the complex non-linear and multi-modal objective functions. Different algorithms have been proposed to identify the parameters of the photovoltaic cells and panels. Most of them commonly fail in finding the optimal solutions. This paper proposes the Chaotic Whale Optimization Algorithm (CWOA) for the parameters estimation of solar cells. The main advantage of the proposed approach is using the chaotic maps to compute and automatically adapt the internal parameters of the optimization algorithm. This situation is beneficial in complex problems, because along the iterative process, the proposed algorithm improves their capabilities to search for the best solution. The modified method is able to optimize complex and multimodal objective functions. For example, the function for the estimation of parameters of solar cells. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm in the solar cell design, it is compared with other optimization methods over different datasets.

The problem of SC design is defined by highly nonlinear and multimodal objective functions. Most of the algorithms proposed to find the best solutions become trapped into local solutions. This paper introduces the Chaotic Improved Artificial Bee Colony (CIABC) algorithm for the estimation of SC parameters.

Since the first publication of this important volume over a decade ago, dramatic changes have taken place with the solar market growing almost 100-fold and the U.S. moving from first to fourth place in the world market as analyzed in this Second Edition. Three bold new opportunities are identified for any countries wanting to improve market position. The first is combining pin solar cells with 3X concentration to achieve economic competitiveness near term. The second is charging battery-powered cars with solar cell-generated electricity from arrays in surrounding areas-including the car owners' homes-while simultaneously reducing their home electricity bills by over ninety percent. The third is formation of economic {\textcopyright}unions{\textcopyright} of sufficient combined economic size to be major competitors. In this updated edition, feed-in tariffs are identified as the most effective approach for public policy. Reasons are provided to explain why pin solar cells outperform more traditional pn solar cells. Field test data are reported for nineteen percent pin solar cells and for {\~{}}500X concentrating systems with bare cell efficiencies approaching forty percent. Paths to bare cell efficiencies over fifty percent are described, and key missing program elements are identified. Since government support is needed for new technology prototype integration and qualification testing before manufacturing scale up, the key economic measure is identified in this volume as the electricity cost in cents per kilowatt-hour at the complete installed system level, rather than just the up-front solar cell modules' costs in dollars per watt.

abstract = {This paper proposes a method of modeling and simulation of photovoltaic arrays. The main objective is to find the parameters of the nonlinear I-V equation by adjusting the curve at three points: open circuit, maximum power, and short circuit. Given these three points, which are provided by all commercial array datasheets, the method finds the best I-V equation for the single-diode photovoltaic (PV) model including the effect of the series and parallel resistances, and warranties that the maximum power of the model matches with the maximum power of the real array. With the parameters of the adjusted I-V equation, one can build a PV circuit model with any circuit simulator by using basic math blocks. The modeling method and the proposed circuit model are useful for power electronics designers who need a simple, fast, accurate, and easy-to-use modeling method for using in simulations of PV systems. In the first pages, the reader will find a tutorial on PV devices and will understand the parameters that compose the single-diode PV model.

abstract = {This paper proposes a new explicit double-diode modeling method based on Lambert W-function (EDDMMLW) for solar cells and photovoltaic (PV) arrays with bypass diodes, respectively. There are mainly two kinds of models for solar cells: single-diode model and double-diode model. Since the two kinds of models are implicit and nonlinear, they are usually needed to converted into explicit expressions. Many explicit expressions of I- V characteristic for single-diode model have been proposed. However, explicit expressions of I- V characteristic for double-diode model are rarely found in the current literature. This paper utilizes Lambert W-function to model explicit expressions of I- V characteristic for double-diode model. Firstly, Lambert W-function is used to obtain an explicit double-diode modeling method for solar cells. Secondly, in order to make the method suitable for solar cells with shading, we propose a new explicit double-diode modeling method for PV arrays with bypass diodes. In addition, this paper presents a new explicit expression for series resistance by using EDDMMLW for solar cells in this paper. It is worth mentioning that the seven cell parameters of double-diode model can be obtained by only using four electrical parameters, i.e., voltage and current at maximum power point, open circuit voltage and short circuit current. Finally, we select MSX-60 module, KC200GT module and SM55 PV array to validate the accuracy and simulation speed of the method proposed in this paper. Simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper is accurate and fast for solar cells and PV arrays with bypass diodes at any conditions.},

abstract = {Due to undeniable environmental, economical and technical reasons, renewable energy-based power generation in electric power systems is continually increasing. Among renewables, photovoltaic (PV) power generation is a viable and attractive choice. For modeling photovoltaic systems, accurate modeling of PV cells is a must. PV cells are often modeled as single diode or double diode models. The process of estimating circuit model parameters of PV cells based on datasheet information or experimental I-V measurements is called PV cell parameter estimation problem and is being frequently researched in the last three decades. The research effort is being put to achieve more accurate circuit model parameters. In this paper, gravitational search algorithm (GSA) with linearly decreasing gravitational constant is proposed for solving PV cell parameter estimation problem. The results of application of the proposed GSA to PV cell parameter estimation problem vividly show its outperformance over GSA with constant gravitational constant, GSA with exponentially decreasing gravitational constant, genetic algorithm, evolutionary programming and Newton algorithm.},

abstract = {Accurate, efficient and reliable parameter extraction of solar photovoltaic (PV) models from the measured current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curves is important for evaluation, modelling, and diagnosis of the actual operating state of in-situ PV arrays. In recent years, numerical heuristic optimization algorithms based parameter extraction methods have been proposed. However, the efficiency and reliability of these methods are limited due to heuristic or stochastic searching strategies. In this paper, by combining the trust-region reflective (TRR) deterministic algorithm with the artificial bee colony (ABC) metaheuristic algorithm, a new hybrid algorithm ABC-TRR is proposed to improve the parameter extraction of PV models. The ABC-TRR algorithm combines the global exploration capability of the ABC and the local exploitation of the TRR, which achieves a good tradeoff among accuracy, convergence and reliability. The proposed ABC-TRR hybrid algorithm is evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using the standard I-V curves of the benchmark Photowatt-PWP201 PV module and RTC France solar cell as well as the measured I-V curves of a laboratory PV module/string/array. Comprehensive experimental analysis and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed ABC-TRR algorithm achieves the same level of accuracy as the best reported algorithms with the highest overall reliability. More importantly, the ABC-TRR algorithm converges 4.69 times faster than the best-reported algorithms on average. In view of these advantages, the proposed ABC-TRR algorithm is a promising alternative for accurately, efficiently and reliably extracting the parameters of PV models from measured I-V curves. In addition, it was experimentally demonstrated that the parameter extraction result can be used to indicate the partial shading and abnormal degradation conditions.},

The optimisation of such systems is always the goal, but the choice of the PV module with best performance should also be considered. Nevertheless, selecting a module from catalogue data has certain inconveniences. First, because those data allow only comparisons with absolute magnitudes, the conclusions about which module is the most appropriate is not easy. Second, data provided in catalogues are not sufficient to know the module behaviour under conditions different from standard. This paper deals with the normalisation of the modules data by considering a base that allows for obtaining a "per unit" representation. For modelling and studying the modules under non-standard conditions it is necessary to know series and shunt resistances, but that is not easy. Then, by simulations, it is possible to show the influence of these resistances in the module behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Simulation, optimization and the design of the hybrid systems that include PV are examples of these applications. The global optimization of the parameters and the applicability for the entire range of the solar radiation and a wide range of temperatures are achievable via this approach.

abstract = {Estimating circuit model parameters of PV cells/modules represents a challenging problem. PV cell/module parameter estimation problem is typically translated into an optimisation problem and is solved by metaheuristic optimisation problems. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is considered as a popular and well-established optimisation algorithm. Despite all its advantages, PSO suffers from premature convergence problem meaning that it may get trapped in local optima. Personal and social acceleration coefficients are two control parameters that, due to their effect on explorative and exploitative capabilities, play important roles in computational behavior of PSO. In this paper, in an attempt toward premature convergence mitigation in PSO, its personal acceleration coefficient is decreased during the course of run, while its social acceleration coefficient is increased. In this way, an appropriate tradeoff between explorative and exploitative capabilities of PSO is established during the course of run and premature convergence problem is significantly mitigated. The results vividly show that in parameter estimation of PV cells and modules, the proposed time varying acceleration coefficients PSO (TVACPSO) offers more accurate parameters than conventional PSO, teaching learning-based optimisation (TLBO) algorithm, imperialistic competitive algorithm (ICA), grey wolf optimisation (GWO), water cycle algorithm (WCA), pattern search (PS) and Newton algorithm. For validation of the proposed methodology, parameter estimation has been done both for RTC France PV cell and Photowatt-PWP 201 PV module. In all terms of mean, best and standard deviation of achieved results, the proposed TVACPSO outperforms other compared algorithms.},

A reliable predictive tool should allow the designer to optimise system performance and to maximise the cost effectiveness of a system prior to installation. This article discusses the five main parametric models for photovoltaic (PV) systems available in the literature. The current-voltage characteristics of a photovoltaic module can be reproduced modelling the PV panel as an equivalent electrical circuit made of linear and non-linear components. The parameters describing such components are directly related to the performance characteristics of the specific PV panel, which are generally available in a graphic form with respect to standard values of temperature and incident irradiance. Five of the most recent models are analysed in detail describing the algorithm, showing how the parameters were determined and highlighting the most important mathematical and physical assumptions that characterised each model and the calculation process. To simplify the examination and reading of the procedures referred to in the five models, all equations are rewritten using the same nomenclature. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of each model with respect to the data provided by the manufacturer, this paper compares the I-V and P-V curves at various temperatures and irradiance for a generic PV panel. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper proposes an improved shuffled complex evolution (ISCE) algorithm for parameter extraction of different PV models, including single diode model, double diode model and single diode solar module model. The novelty of proposed ISCE algorithm lies primary in the improved competitive complex evolution strategy, where three amendments are proposed to overcome the shortcomings of original SCE algorithm.

(2) The reflecting-absorbing bound- handling method is employed to enhance the chance of global search and avoid being trapped in local minima.

In order to test the parameter extraction performance of proposed ISCE and compare it with some state-of-the-art algorithms, the standard datasets and practical measured datasets of one solar cell and three solar modules are selected for parameter extraction of different PV models. Comparison results indicate that the proposed ISCE algorithm always exhibits the highest computational efficiency to get the most accurate parameter values among all compared algorithms. More importantly, the proposed ISCE algorithm generally promises better convergence speed and robustness than the best reported algorithms.

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel three-point based parameter extraction method for the single diode model. Unlike conventional curve-fitting procedures, the solution is simplistic yet exhibits outstanding ability to locate highly accurate solutions within very low number of iterations. The main idea is to establish three geometrically critical data points as the pivot points. By forcing the model to pass though these points exactly, the evolutionary algorithm (in this case differential evolution) is only utilized to fine-tune the remaining sections of the curve for best fit. As a result, the complexity of the algorithm is greatly reduced. A set of comparisons based on four case studies indicates that the proposed method substantially more accurate than other documented methods. Additionally, other tests with different types of photovoltaic modules (i.e. monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin film) at varying environmental conditions prove that the algorithm is reliable and practical for real-world applications. Besides, the scheme is highly efficient—it converges to the optimal solution in less than 50 iterations. Moreover, the solutions obtained are exceptionally consistent, i.e. the standard deviation of the root-mean-square error over 35 runs is at least 4 orders of magnitude less than those reported in other works. With these merits, the proposed method is envisaged to be valuable for both offline analysis and online monitoring applications where an accurate, fast and consistent parameter extraction tool is required.},

Current knowledge and many successful experiments suggest that the application of GAs is not limited to easy-to-optimize unimodal functions. Several results and GA theory give the impression that GAs easily escape from millions of local optima and reliably converge to a single global optimum. The theoretical analysis presented in this paper shows that most of the widely-used test functions have n independent parameters and that, when optimizing such functions, many GAs scale with an O(n ln n) complexity. Furthermore, it is shown that the current design of GAs and its parameter settings are optimal with respect to independent parameters. Both analysis and results show that a rotation of the coordinate system causes a severe performance loss to GAs that use a small mutation rate. In case of a rotation, the GA's complexity can increase up to 0(n(n)) = 0(exp(n ln n)). Future work should find new GA designs that solve this performance loss. As long as these problems have not been solved, the application of GAs will be limited to the optimization of easy-to-optimize functions.},

France) silicon solar cell and a module consisting of 36 polycrystalline silicon cells (Photowatt-PWP 201) are used to test and verify the consistency of accurately estimating various parameters. Comparative study among different parameter estimation techniques is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, to verify the accurateness of the proposed technique, an experimental test bench unit is built using 72 mono-crystalline silicon cells (HIP-210NKHB5-2 module) on different environment conditions.},

abstract = {In a single crystal of semiconductor the impurity concentration may vary from p‐type to n‐type producing a mechanically continuous rectifying junction. The theory of potential distribution and rectification for p‐n junctions is developed with emphasis on germanium. The currents across the junction are carried by the diffusion of holes in n‐type material and electrons in p‐type material, resulting in an admittance for a simple case varying as (1 + i$\omega$$\tau$p)1/2 where $\tau$p is the lifetime of a hole in the n‐region. Contact potentials across p‐n junctions, carrying no current, may develop when hole or electron injection occurs. The principles and theory of a p‐n‐p transistor are described. {\textcopyright} 1949 The Bell System Technical Journal},

abstract = {Today, photovoltaic (PV) systems are generating a significant share of electric power. Parameter estimation of photovoltaic cells and modules is a hot research topic and plays an important role in modelling PV systems. This problem is commonly converted into an optimisation problem and is solved by metaheuristic optimisation algorithms. Among metaheuristic optimisation algorithms, particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is a popular leader-based stochastic optimisation algorithm. However, premature convergence is the main drawback of PSO which does not let it to provide high-quality solutions in multimodal problems such as PV cells/modules parameter estimation. In PSO, all particles are pulled toward the leader, so the leader can significantly affect collective performance of the particles. A high-quality leader may pull all particles toward good regions of search space and vice versa. Therefore, in this research, an improved PSO variant, with enhanced leader, named as enhanced leader PSO (ELPSO) is used. In ELPSO, by enhancing the leader through a five-staged successive mutation strategy, the premature convergence problem is mitigated in a way that more accurate circuit model parameters are achieved in the PV cell/module parameter estimation problem. RTC France silicon solar cell, STM6-40/36 module with monocrystalline cells and PVM 752 GaAs thin film cell have been used as the case studies of this research. Parameter estimation results for various PV cells and modules of different technologies confirm that in most of the cases, ELPSO outperforms conventional PSO and a couple of other state of the art optimisation algorithms.},

abstract = {In order to find an upper theoretical limit for the efficiency of p-n junction solar energy converters, a limiting efficiency, called the detailed balance limit of efficiency, has been calculated for an ideal case in which the only recombination mechanism of hole-electron pairs is radiative as required by the principle of detailed balance. The efficiency is also calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed fraction fc of the total recombination, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30{\%} for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1. Actual junctions do not obey the predicted current-voltage relationship, and reasons for the difference and its relevance to efficiency are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1961 The American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In recent years, continuous depletion of conventional energy resources and the fluctuating fuel cost have motivated research on alternative source for power generation. To effectively harvest power from the green energy resources, extensive research have been carried out in literature. Solar energy being the foremost among all other renewable energy resources has evolved as a reliable substitute for the conventional power generation. Unlike other sources, real time research on Photovoltaic (PV) Systems is a difficult assignment as it necessitates an accurate PV emulator that can precisely replicate the nonlinear characteristics of a PV cell. PV Researchers have developed emulators of different type utilizing various configurations. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive review on different PV emulator topologies so as to gather all the research activities that are scattered in this arena under a common umbrella. Further this paper provides a detailed analysis of each technique emphasizing on its (i) Realization cost (ii) Accuracy (iii) Level of complexity (iv) Sensitiveness to varying environmental conditions (v) Hardware implementation and (vi) Efficiency.},

The parameters of interest are the photon current, the series and shunt resistance's, the ideality factor, and the diode reverse saturation current. Hence the different parameters have to be known at all operating condition which is practically not available in many cases. So, in this paper we will introduce a new type of data analysis that express these parameters by means of a fuzzy regression model. The available PV array under consideration is defined by the manufacturer data sheet which specifies the panel under a narrow range of operating conditions. A fuzzy model has been developed for the aforementioned PV arrays. The model has been validated using a set of data that have been obtained at our site or obtained from extrapolating data from the manufacturer data sheet.},
