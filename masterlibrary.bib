abstract = {This paper proposes a novel three-point based parameter extraction method for the single diode model. Unlike conventional curve-fitting procedures, the solution is simplistic yet exhibits outstanding ability to locate highly accurate solutions within very low number of iterations. The main idea is to establish three geometrically critical data points as the pivot points. By forcing the model to pass though these points exactly, the evolutionary algorithm (in this case differential evolution) is only utilized to fine-tune the remaining sections of the curve for best fit. As a result, the complexity of the algorithm is greatly reduced. A set of comparisons based on four case studies indicates that the proposed method substantially more accurate than other documented methods. Additionally, other tests with different types of photovoltaic modules (i.e. monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin film) at varying environmental conditions prove that the algorithm is reliable and practical for real-world applications. Besides, the scheme is highly efficient—it converges to the optimal solution in less than 50 iterations. Moreover, the solutions obtained are exceptionally consistent, i.e. the standard deviation of the root-mean-square error over 35 runs is at least 4 orders of magnitude less than those reported in other works. With these merits, the proposed method is envisaged to be valuable for both offline analysis and online monitoring applications where an accurate, fast and consistent parameter extraction tool is required.},

Here, we analyse the progress in cells and modules based on single-crystalline GaAs, Si, GaInP and InP, multicrystalline Si as well as thin films of polycrystalline CdTe and CuIn x Ga 1−x Se 2 . In addition, we analyse the PV developments of the more recently emerged lead halide perovskites together with notable improvements in sustainable chalcogenides, organic PVs and quantum dots technologies. In addition to power conversion efficiencies, we consider many of the factors that affect power output for each cell type and note improvements in control over the optoelectronic quality of PV-relevant materials and interfaces and the discovery of new material properties. By comparing PV cell parameters across technologies, we appraise how far each technology may progress in the near future. Although accurate or revolutionary developments cannot be predicted, cross-fertilization between technologies often occurs, making achievements in one cell type an indicator of evolutionary developments in others. This knowledge transfer is timely, as the development of metal halide perovskites is helping to unite previously disparate, technology-focused strands of PV research.},

abstract = {Parameter extraction of solar cell models plays an important role in the simulation and design calculation of photovoltaic (PV) systems. In this paper, in order to fast and accurately extract the solar cell parameters, an improved adaptive differential evolution with crossover rate repairing technique and ranking-based mutation is proposed. The proposed method is referred to as Rcr-IJADE, which is an improved version of JADE. In Rcr-IJADE, including the parameter adaptation presented in JADE, the crossover rate repairing technique and the ranking-based mutation are also synergized to improve the performance of JADE when solving the parameter extraction problems of solar cell models. In order to verify the performance of Rcr-IJADE, it is used to extract the parameters of different solar cell models, i.e., single diode, double diode, and PV module. Compared with other parameter extraction techniques, experimental results indicate the superiority of Rcr-IJADE in terms of the quality of final solutions, success rate, and convergence speed. In addition, the simulated data with the extracted parameters of Rcr-IJADE are in very good agreement with the experimental data in all cases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Predictive performance tools are an important factor in the success of any new technology because they permit demonstration of whether a system will be efficient and economically feasible. A reliable predictive tool should allow the designer to optimise system performance and to maximise the cost effectiveness of a system prior to installation. This article discusses the five main parametric models for photovoltaic (PV) systems available in the literature. The current-voltage characteristics of a photovoltaic module can be reproduced modelling the PV panel as an equivalent electrical circuit made of linear and non-linear components. The parameters describing such components are directly related to the performance characteristics of the specific PV panel, which are generally available in a graphic form with respect to standard values of temperature and incident irradiance. Five of the most recent models are analysed in detail describing the algorithm, showing how the parameters were determined and highlighting the most important mathematical and physical assumptions that characterised each model and the calculation process. To simplify the examination and reading of the procedures referred to in the five models, all equations are rewritten using the same nomenclature. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of each model with respect to the data provided by the manufacturer, this paper compares the I-V and P-V curves at various temperatures and irradiance for a generic PV panel. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Soiling is a factor caused by the accumulation of dust and dirt on the PV surface and limiting the penetration of solar energy; hence, reduces the energy output. This paper discusses in details on the types of soiling and presents some mitigation techniques which have been studied and developed.

Since the first publication of this important volume over a decade ago, dramatic changes have taken place with the solar market growing almost 100-fold and the U.S. moving from first to fourth place in the world market as analyzed in this Second Edition. Three bold new opportunities are identified for any countries wanting to improve market position. The first is combining pin solar cells with 3X concentration to achieve economic competitiveness near term. The second is charging battery-powered cars with solar cell-generated electricity from arrays in surrounding areas-including the car owners' homes-while simultaneously reducing their home electricity bills by over ninety percent. The third is formation of economic {\textcopyright}unions{\textcopyright} of sufficient combined economic size to be major competitors. In this updated edition, feed-in tariffs are identified as the most effective approach for public policy. Reasons are provided to explain why pin solar cells outperform more traditional pn solar cells. Field test data are reported for nineteen percent pin solar cells and for {\~{}}500X concentrating systems with bare cell efficiencies approaching forty percent. Paths to bare cell efficiencies over fifty percent are described, and key missing program elements are identified. Since government support is needed for new technology prototype integration and qualification testing before manufacturing scale up, the key economic measure is identified in this volume as the electricity cost in cents per kilowatt-hour at the complete installed system level, rather than just the up-front solar cell modules' costs in dollars per watt.

The optimisation of such systems is always the goal, but the choice of the PV module with best performance should also be considered. Nevertheless, selecting a module from catalogue data has certain inconveniences. First, because those data allow only comparisons with absolute magnitudes, the conclusions about which module is the most appropriate is not easy. Second, data provided in catalogues are not sufficient to know the module behaviour under conditions different from standard. This paper deals with the normalisation of the modules data by considering a base that allows for obtaining a "per unit" representation.

abstract = {The effect of changes in five physically meaningful parameters on the I-V (current-voltage) curve of a CdS solar cell is calculated. Comparisons between the calculated data and performance data obtained from degraded solar cells are made. The parameter that changed to cause the degradation in each cell becomes apparent.
